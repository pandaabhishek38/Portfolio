        I’ve built scalable web apps, secure banking systems, and deep learning
        models for critical use cases like plant species classification and
        melanoma detection. My toolbelt includes technologies like React,
        Node.js, Express, Python, Flask, TensorFlow, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

        I love solving real-world problems through code and continuously
        exploring new technologies—from AI integrations to robust system design.
        I'm currently focused on building fast, clean, and user-centric
        applications.
